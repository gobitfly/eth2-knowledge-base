# ⚒️ Manage Validators

This is the place where you can add and delete validators and assign them to groups. (Groups can be created in the Group Manage modal on the dashboard)

***



## Bulk adding to the validator dashboard

Users looking to add thousands of validators have several options:

* Add validators using our [API](manage-validators-api.md)
* Add validators using validator **graffiti**
* Add validators by **deposit address**
* Add validators by **withdrawal credentials**
* Add validators with a **comma-separated** list via validator indices or validator public key (e.g., `1,2,3,4,5`)

## Filtering validators in the validator manage modal

#### Filter for a specific group

* To view validators from a specific group, select the group from the top left dropdown.
* Adding a validator while a group filter is active assigns the validator to that group.
* Adding a validator under 'All groups' sets the default group for the newly added validator.

#### Quick add to a group

* Adding a validator while a group filter is active assigns the validator to that group.
* Adding a validator under 'All groups' sets the default group for the newly added validator.
