# ü§ù Share your custom dashboard

The [Group ](validator-groups.md)feature makes every dashboard unique. For example, even if two dashboards contain the same validators, the charts and statistics would be different if the validators weere assigned to different groups. Thus, the dashboard allows you to share (read-only) a dashboard with its custom settings.&#x20;

This is extremely useful for larger staking entities that want to share their validator set internally, without providing access to a sensitive database.
